Social Media Tweets Analysis — Power BI Internship Project

-Project Overview

This project was completed as part of a Power BI internship assignment focused on analysing social media tweet engagement. The objective was to create interactive dashboards using DAX calculations, conditional filters, and time-based visibility rules to understand user interaction patterns.

The dataset includes tweet text, engagement metrics, media interactions, impressions, and timestamp information.

-Tools Used

* Microsoft Power BI
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
* Data Cleaning and Conditional Filtering

--Tasks Implemented

Task 1 — Evening Interaction Analysis**

A dashboard was created to analyse tweet engagement during evening hours with a condition that tweet word count must be greater than 50. Since the dataset did not contain tweets exceeding this length, the visual appeared empty, confirming correct filter application.

Task 2 — Interaction Comparison by Tweet Category**

A clustered bar chart compared URL clicks, profile clicks, and hashtag clicks across tweet categories. The visual remained empty due to the dataset not meeting the required tweet word count above 40 along with time constraints.

Task 3 — Top 10 Tweets by Likes and Retweets**

A ranking chart successfully displayed the top 10 tweets based on combined likes and retweets while excluding weekends and applying multiple conditional filters such as odd tweet date and even impressions.

Task 4 — Monthly Engagement Trend**

A line chart analysed average monthly engagement rate for tweets with and without media. The visual appeared empty after applying a filter to remove tweets containing the letter **C**, indicating strict text filtering impact.

Task 5 — Media Engagement Above Median Analysis**

A comparison chart analysed replies, retweets, and likes for tweets whose media engagement exceeded the median value between June and August 2020. The visual became empty when removing tweets containing the letter **S**, highlighting dataset limitations.

Task 6 — Engagement Rate Comparison (App Opens vs Non-App Opens)**

A comparison visual successfully analysed engagement rate between tweets generating deeper interaction (approximated using user profile clicks as app opens) and tweets without such interaction while applying weekday, time, and engagement filters.

Key Learnings

* Practical experience with DAX calculations and measures
* Time-based dashboard visibility logic
* Handling strict filtering conditions and empty visuals
* Debugging filter conflicts and dataset limitations
* Designing clear and interpretable Power BI dashboards
